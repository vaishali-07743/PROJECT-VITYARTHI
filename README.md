# PROJECT-VITYARTHI
A PYTHON CHATBOT

>Overview of the Project

This project is a simple and modular Python chatbot application that allows users to interact through a command-line interface. It supports user login, keyword-based response generation, persistent chat history stored per user, and displays full conversation logs at the end of each chat session. The design is prepared for future enhancements such as NLP or machine learning integration.

>Features

User authentication and session management

Keyword and pattern matching for generating automated responses

Continuous conversation loop until user issues an exit command

Persistent storage of chat history in JSON format

Display of conversation logs after chat session ends

Modular design for easy maintenance and extensibility

>Technologies/Tools Used

Python 3.6+

JSON for persistent data storage

Standard Python libraries: json, os, datetime

#Steps to Install & Run the Project

Ensure Python 3.6 or higher is installed on your machine.

Download or clone the project files.

Open terminal or command prompt in the project directory

Run the chatbot script with:
text
python chatbot.py

Enter your username to log in or create a new user.

Start chatting with the bot.

Type bye, exit, or quit to end the session.

View your chat log displayed on the screen.

>Instructions for Testing

Test the chatbot by typing greetings like "hello" or "hi" and see the appropriate response.

Ask for the current time by typing "time".

Type unsupported statements to check the default fallback response.

Use exit commands (bye, exit, quit) to end the chat and verify the conversation log display.

Verify that chat logs persist by restarting the program with the same username.
